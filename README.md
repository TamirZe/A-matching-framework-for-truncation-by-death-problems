A matching framework for truncation by death problems
================



Reproducibility of simulation results and data analysis associated with the paper "A matching framework for truncation by death problems" by Zehavi and Nevo.

This repository includes two main parts, and additional folder containing the EM algorithms we have applied and adjusted.

1. Simulations: simulation scripts, simulation results and simulation summary.
(Figures 2 and Table 2 in the paper's main text, and (Figures 1&2 and Tables 5&6 in the Supplementary).
Information regarding the parameters were used in each of the Scenarios is given in Tables 1,2,3,4 in the Supplementary

2. Data_analysis: 

3. Ding and Lu EM algorithms: this folder contains our adjustment for sensitivity analysis for Monotonicity.
