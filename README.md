#### A matching framework for truncation by death problems


Reproducibility of numerical examples and of simulation results associated with the paper "Causal inference for semi-competing risks data" by Nevo and Gorfine (2021+, Biostatistics). Comments and suggestions are welcomed and can be sent to danielnevo üêº @ üêº gmail.com (remove the pandas).

This repository includes two main parts

Simulations: Simulation scripts, simulation results and simulation summary.
Exact numerical examples for large sample (Figures 2 & 3 in the paper).


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
