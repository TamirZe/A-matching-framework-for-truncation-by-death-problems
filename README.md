A matching framework for truncation by death problems
================



Reproducibility of simulation results and data analysis associated with the paper "A matching framework for truncation by death problems" by Zehavi and Nevo.

This repository includes two main parts, and additional folder containing the EM algorithms we have adjusted and applied.

1. Simulations: Simulation scripts, simulation results and simulation summary.
 (Figures 2 & 3 in the paper).
2. Data_analysis: 
3. Ding and Lu EM algorithms: this folder contains our adjustment for sensitivity analysis for Monotonicity.
